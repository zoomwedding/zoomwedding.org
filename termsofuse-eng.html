		<h3>SERVICES:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>To use our services, you need to fill out an application form. The application form requires you to upload photos of yourself and your partner, as well as other personal information specified in the form. By filling out the form, you voluntarily consent to the processing, transmission, storage, and deletion of your personal data by the Website, and give the Website and its employees permission to use your personal data to apply for a marriage license on your behalf and to digitally sign the application for you.
			Once we receive your application, we will provide you with a marriage license that allows you to legally participate in the wedding ceremony as a couple.</li>
			<li>You need to provide identification for two witnesses over 18 years old (international documents containing Latin alphabet information) who will be present at the ceremony and participate in the video call during the ceremony. However, witnesses do not have to be physically in the same place as the couple.</li>
			<li>During the ceremony, the officer will verify the identities of the couple and the two witnesses. The ceremony is conducted by an authorized officer of Utah County, Utah, USA, using a standard script that complies with Utah state legal requirements.</li>
			<li>You will have the opportunity to exchange vows and rings if you wish to do so. The officer will ask you, the marrying couple, whether you wish to marry each other, and both of you must respond, "I do."</li>
			<li>After the ceremony, we will finalize the registration of your wedding with the county official. You will receive a certified digital copy of the marriage certificate. A paper copy will be sent to you via standard mail, with delivery times depending on your location.</li>
			<li>The wedding ceremony must be held within 30 days of the issuance of the marriage license. If we cannot hold the ceremony within 30 days, you will need to apply for a new marriage license, and the ceremony must be conducted within 30 days of the issuance of the new license.</li>
			<li>We cannot guarantee the delivery date of the paper copy of the marriage certificate. However, we will send the certificate within 15 days of its receipt. The certificate should reach you within the delivery time of the postal service or transportation company.</li>
			<li>The official language of the ceremony is English. It is the user's responsibility to find a translator for other languages if the couple or witnesses do not have sufficient English proficiency and require simultaneous translation.</li>
			<li>All documents provided by the couple and witnesses for identification must contain information in the Latin alphabet (passport, driver's license, etc.) and be valid at the time of the ceremony.</li>
