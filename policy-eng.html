        <p>When you access or use our Services, we automatically collect information about you, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Usage information: if you send us personal correspondence such as emails or letters, we may collect such information into a file specifically designed for you.</li>
            <li>Log information: we record information about your usage of our website, including the type and language of your browser, access time, pages viewed, your IP address, and the website you visited before navigating to our website.</li>
            <li>Device information: we may collect information about the device you use to access our Services, including hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers, phone number, International Mobile Equipment Identity ("IMEI"), and information about the mobile network.</li>
            <li>Location information: with your consent, we may collect information about the location of your device to facilitate certain features of our Services, determine the speed at which your device is moving, add location-based filters (e.g., local weather), and for any other purpose.</li>
            <li>Information collected through cookies and other tracking technologies: we use various technologies to collect information, including sending you cookies. Cookies are small data files sent to your computer's hard drive that allow a website to respond to you as an individual user by gathering and remembering information about your preferences to tailor its operation to your needs, likes, and dislikes. Cookies are generally safe because they identify your computer only to customize your web experience. Acceptance of a cookie does not give us access to your computer or any personally identifiable information about you other than the information you choose to share. Other servers cannot read them, and they cannot be used to deliver a virus. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually configure yours (Microsoft Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Google Chrome) to notify you of cookie placement requests, reject certain cookies, or reject all cookies completely. If you disable cookies completely, some features of the website may be unavailable to you, and some web pages may display improperly. To support personalized features of our website, we must send a cookie to your computer's hard drive and/or use cookie-based authentication to identify you as a registered user of the website. However, we do not use so-called "tracking cookies" that track your activity elsewhere on the Internet. We may also collect information using web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels").</li>
            <li>Web beacons or transparent .gif files are small pieces of code embedded on a web page to track behavior and collect data about visitors viewing the web page. For example, web beacons or similar technology may be used to count users visiting the website or to deliver cookies to the visitor's browser viewing this page. We may use web beacons or similar technologies from time to time in our Services for this and other purposes.</li>
            <li>Geolocation - when visiting the website, you will be prompted to enable location detection services. If you enable these features, we may collect data about the location of your device and store the coordinates of your device to offer you certain features. Even if you have disabled location detection services, we can still determine your city, region, and country based on your IP address (but not your exact location).</li>
